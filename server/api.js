Joining McGarrett is Detective Danny "Danno" Williams, a relocated ex-New Jersey cop - a working man in paradise who prefers skyscrapers to the coastline - but who's committed to keeping the Islands safe for his young daughter; Chin Ho Kelly, an ex-Honolulu police detective and former protégé of McGarrett's father who was wrongly accused of corruption; Dr. Max Bergman, the quirky coroner; Chin's cousin, Kono Kalakaua, a beautiful and fearless native; and Captain Lou Grover, who formerly headed Hawaii's SWAT unit. Joining them is Jerry Ortega, a former classmate of Chin's and the Island's local conspiracy theorist. The state's brash FIVE-0 unit, who may spar and jest among themselves, remain determined to eliminate the seedy elements from the 50th state.</p>`,

    summary: "<p>The people of Arcadia, Missouri are forever changed when their deceased loved ones suddenly start to reappear. An 8-year-old American boy wakes up alone in a rice paddy in a rural Chinese province with no idea how he got there. Details start to emerge when the boy, who calls himself Jacob, recalls that his hometown is Arcadia, and an Immigration agent, J. Martin Bellamy, takes him there. The home he claims as his own is occupied by a 60-year-old couple, Henry and Lucille Langston, who lost their son, Jacob, more than 30 years ago. While they look different, young Jacob recognizes them as his parents. Lucille is overjoyed at the seeming miracle of her son's reappearance. Henry is reluctant to accept that Jacob is back. Those closest to the family want answers, including Sheriff Fred Langston, whose wife Barbara drowned 30 years ago while trying to save Jacob, and Fred's daughter, Maggie, a local doctor. Pastor Tom Hale seeks a spiritual reason for what's happening in his community. When things take an even more shocking turn, Maggie's life-long friend, Elaine Richards, finds herself drawn into Arcadia's growing mystery. Bellamy, an outsider in the town, joins forces with Maggie to figure out why the unexplainable is happening in Arcadia. As their investigation plays out, Maggie learns some unsettling truths about her own past. Will they be able to solve the mystery of Arcadia before the rest of the world catches on to events there? And will they be able to protect Jacob from forces beyond their control?</p>",

    summary: `<p><b>Scorpion</b>, inspired by a true story, is a high-octane drama about eccentric genius Walter O'Brien and his team of brilliant misfits who comprise the last line of defense against complex, high-tech threats of the modern age. As Homeland Security's new think tank, O'Brien's "Scorpion" team includes Toby Curtis an expert behaviorist who can read anyone; Happy Quinn, a mechanical prodigy; and Sylvester Dodd, a statistics guru. Pooling their extensive technological knowledge to solve mind-boggling predicaments amazes federal agent Cabe Gallo, who shares a harrowing history with O'Brien. However, while this socially awkward group is comfortable with each other's humor and quirks, life outside their circle confounds them, so they rely on Paige Dineen, who has a young, gifted son, to translate the world for them. At last, these nerdy masterminds have found the perfect job: a place where they can apply their exceptional brainpower to solve the nation's crises, while also helping each other learn how to fit in.</p>`,

    summary: `<p><b>NCIS: New Orleans </b>is a drama about the local field office that investigates criminal cases involving military personnel in The Big Easy, a city known for its music, entertainment and decadence. Leading the team is Special Agent Dwayne Pride, a.k.a. "King," a native of New Orleans who is driven by his need to do what is right. Working with Pride is Special Agent Christopher LaSalle, who plays hard but works harder and former ATF agent Sonja Percy, who is still adjusting to the team after years of solo undercover assignments. Supporting them is coroner Dr. Loretta Wade, who is as eccentric as she is smart; her brilliant, quirky Forensic Scientist, Sebastian Lund; and Investigative Computer Specialist Patton Plame, an animated and talented hacker. New to the team is Special Agent Tammy Gregorio, a tough, acerbic FBI agent with a mysterious past in New Orleans, who is sent from D.C. to investigate the NCIS team, but also work with Pride when high-risk cases threaten the city. This colorful city that harbors a dark side is a magnet for service personnel on leave, and when overindulgence is followed by trouble, Pride's team is at its best</p>`,

    summary: `<p>Before there were parenting blogs, trophies for showing up and peanut allergies, there was a simpler time called the '80s. For geeky and movie obsessed youngest child Adam, these were his wonder years, and he faced them armed with a video camera to capture all the crazy. <b>The Goldbergs</b> are a loving family like any other -- just with a lot more yelling. Mom Beverly is a classic "smother," an overbearing, overprotective matriarch who loves her delicious kids, but still rules this brood with 100% authority and zero sense of boundaries. Dad Murray is gruff and sometimes oblivious, parenting with half his attention span but all his heart. Sister Erica is popular and terrifying, doing her best to cover up that she's the smartest of the clan. Barry is a passionate dreamer, who maybe dreams a little too big and who always gets the short end of the stick. Adam is the youngest, a camera-wielding future director who's navigating first love, and growing up with his family. Rounding out the family is beloved grandfather Al "Pops" Solomon, the wild man of the clan, a shameless Don Juan who's learning as much from his family as he teaches them.</p>`,

As the name suggests, this family represents a modern-day family, and episodes are comically based on situations which many families encounter in real life.</p>`,

Marco understands the slippery politics of Mexican law enforcement, and while his police force slowly succumbs to the pressures and demands of the cartel, he's one of the last good men in the department. He's charming but will do whatever it takes to get what he needs -- which doesn't sit well with Sonya, who has Asperger's and strictly follows rules and protocol. The case quickly pulls them into a string of murders on the border, a scene already consumed by illegal immigration, drug trafficking, violence, and prostitution.</p>",

    summary: `<p>NBC's <b>The Biggest Loser</b>, a show known for its incredible weight loss makeovers, will reveal an exciting makeover of its own when the popular series returns on Monday, January 4 (9-11 p.m. ET) with new host Bob Harper, a new "Temptation" theme, an updated state-of-the-art gym, a new logo, fun format changes and a return to the popular team vs. team competition. Dolvett Quince and Jen Widerstrom return to train eight contestant teams of two, all with compelling stories. Seven teams (spouses, parent/adult child, siblings, relatives, best friends) will know each other, but one team will be two strangers - former "Celebrity Apprentice" contestant and the original "Survivor" winner, Richard Hatch, and 'The Voice' season two semi-finalist Erin Willett. Having both been in the NBC family previously, the two share the same goal as the other 14 contestants - to change their lives and get healthy. The renovated "Biggest Loser" gym, featuring a new interior and exterior branded with the new logo, has modernized equipment to help contestants better achieve their fitness goals, including eight high-tech monitors on the walls of each side of the gym that will track contestants' calorie burns as well as heart rates. Half of the gym will be dedicated to Team Dolvett and the other half dedicated to Team Jen. The weigh-in will be very different this season with a new look and double scales, so contestants on opposing teams can weigh-in side by side, making the weigh-in even more compelling to watch. The contestant house is also getting a whole new look for season 17.</p>`,

    summary: `<p><b>Blue Bloods </b>is a drama about a multi-generational family of cops dedicated to New York City law enforcement. Frank Reagan is the New York Police Commissioner and heads both the police force and the Reagan brood. He runs his department as diplomatically as he runs his family, even when dealing with the politics that plagued his unapologetically bold father, Henry, during his stint as Chief. A source of pride and concern for Frank is his eldest son Danny, a seasoned detective, family man and Iraq War vet who on occasion uses dubious tactics to solve cases with his loyal and tough partner, Detective Jackie Curatola. The Reagan women in the family include Erin, a N.Y. Assistant D.A., who also serves as the legal compass for her siblings and father, and single parent to her teenage daughter Nicky; and Linda, Danny's supportive wife. Jamie is the youngest Reagan, a recent grad of Harvard Law and the family's "golden boy." Unable to deny the family tradition, Jamie has decided to give up a lucrative future in law and follow in the family footsteps as a cop.</p>`,
